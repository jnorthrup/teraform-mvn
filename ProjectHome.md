this shell script creates a standalone maven reactor of archetype generated projects from a tree of existing projects

this is a shell script specific to bash

the source code is self-documenting with builtin help features and maven2 finetunable env vars

depends on gsed and gnu tools for instance macports or cygwin for non-linux env's

various common tasks can be added and improved within commented sections.

NOTE: maven 3.x appears to break this script but mvn 2.1.1 appears to continue to work.
